## UI/UX Overview
### *1. Visual Style*
I used a dark theme with orange accents to match the UAV/defense feel of the project.  
The fonts are modern and clean so the text looks sharp and easy to read.

### *2. Layout & Sections*
The website is divided into clear sections like **Hero, Services, Products, About, and Contact**.  
Each section has enough spacing so it doesn’t feel cluttered, and I tried to keep the layout simple and easy to follow.

### *3. Animations*
I added smooth scrolling using **Lenis** and fade-in animations with **Framer Motion** so the sections appear smoothly when scrolling.  
The hero heading also includes a **typewriter effect** to make it feel more dynamic.

### *4. Responsive Design*
I made sure the UI works well on mobile screens by including:

- A mobile-friendly hamburger menu  
- A separate background image for smaller devices  
- Responsive grids for the cards  

This keeps the design usable across different screen sizes.

### *5. Reusable Components*
I created reusable components like **cards, buttons, and section wrappers** to keep the code cleaner and easier to manage as the project grows.
